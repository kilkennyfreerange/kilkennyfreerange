            <hr class="narrow fat">
            <p>The goslings are introduced to open air pasture as soon as possible depending on weather. This usually happens at 2-3 weeks old. Our lands are fully protected from predators. This allows them the freedom to roam and graze until late September.</p>
            <p>Depending on grass availability, their feed is then supplemented with wheat. From mid-October they are fed adlib. The geese are primarily reared for the Christmas market.</p>

            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>We manage production from day old birds to the end customer. Our volume of production is small by industry standards thereby ensuring that we maintain the highest quality.</p>
            <p>Our ducklings and goslings are initially fed a starter crumb and after 10 days are introduced to duck goose grower produced by Connollys Red Mills, Goresbridge, Kilkenny.</p>

            <h4>Animal Welfare</h4>
            <p>We are equally concerned for the welfare of the birds we produce. This is achieved by adhering to the 5 freedoms as determined by "Freedom Food" standards.</p>

            <h4>The Five Freedoms</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Freedom from hunger and thirst.</li>
              <li>Freedom from discomfort.</li>
              <li>Freedom from pain, injury or disease.</li>
              <li>Freedom to express normal behaviour.</li>

            <h4>Processing</h4>
            <p>The processing method for both ducks and geese is very similar. All birds are slaughtered by recognised humane standards. They are initially dry-plucked and hung in a cold-room on site for up to 10 days. This allows the meat to mature. Following this they are eviscerated and immediately delivered to the customer.</p>
